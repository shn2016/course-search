#### Functionality

* Use the API we provider with you under `fixture` folder.
* Load the data from the API and implement the page with whatever technology you like.
* Results/courses can be filtered by `title` with the input value.
* Results/courses can be filtered by the left panel.

#### Requirements

* Clear documentation, including but not limited to how to test your code.
* Proper unit tests.

#### Time

We expect you finish your work in 1 week. But it doesn't mean you can't spend more than 1 week. 1 week is an expectation from us, thinking how hard it is and how much time you can spend for the test.

## What we care

There is no best solution for each test, you can choose any library or tool you want. But please keep in mind we're interested in your code and the way you think, not how well you use frameworks/libraries. We will take your work seriously, and make sure you will get the review fast and helpful.
